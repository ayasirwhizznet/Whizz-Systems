                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Consequences of Overheating</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">When a device overheats, it can lead to performance issues, unexpected shutdowns, and
                    even permanent damage to the inside components. There are several techniques for cooling, including
                    different styles of heatsinks, thermoelectric coolers, forced air systems, fans, and heat channels.
                    In power electronics, cooling systems must evacuate excess heat to maintain reliability and power
                    density. So, electronic components should always operate within their rated operating temperature
                    range, the safe operating area (SOA).Â [2]</p>
                <p class="my-4">Overheating can happen for different reasons, including intemperate utilization, poor
                    ventilation, and defective cooling systems. Extreme heat can slow and even damage devices [3].</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Working Principle and Concept</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Heatsinks operate on the fundamental principle that heat transfer from a hot to a cool
                    region is proportional to the available surface area, as governed by the second law of
                    thermodynamics. Heatsinks conduct heat away from critical electronic components, maintaining them
                    within their rated operating temperature range. The absorbed heat is then removed through natural or
                    forced air convection.</p>
                <p class="my-4">Heatsinks function either passively through natural convection or actively using
                    mechanisms like fans or liquid cooling to improve heat dissipation. Key performance factors for
                    heatsink design include:</p>

                <ul class="list-outside list-disc ml-10">
                    <li>Surface area</li>
                    <li>Material choice</li>
                    <li>Fin geometry</li>
                    <li>Base dimensions</li>
                    <li>Innovative elements like varying sizes, scales, and protrusions</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="my-4">Optimizing these parameters will enhance heat exchange efficiency or thermal
                    conductivity, resulting improvement of heat transfer coefficient.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Active and Passive Heatsink</h2>
                <p class="my-4">Heatsinks are classified into passive and active cooling methods. Passive cooling relies
                    on natural convection and radiation for heat dissipation without external assistance. On the other
                    hand, active cooling employs external devices like fans, pumps, or thermoelectric coolers (TECs) to
                    boost heat transfer and cooling efficiency. The choice of a heatsink is determined by the necessary
                    resistance to meet component thermal requirements with active solutions such as forced air or liquid
                    cooling offering tailored thermal management solutions at different levels. (See Fig. 1) [5]</p>
