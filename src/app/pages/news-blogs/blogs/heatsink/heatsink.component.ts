TIMs bridge microscopic gaps and imperfections between the mating surfaces, ensuring a low-resistance thermal pathway for heat dissipation. Using TIM enhances thermal conductivity and eliminates air pockets, leading to more efficient heat transfer. All interface surfaces should be smooth and flat. Use heatsink thermal grease or TIM between the heatsink and the device. This will increase the thermal transfer between the two parts; however, excessive quantities of heatsink grease will decrease performance'
